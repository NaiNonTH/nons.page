## My Titles

### How I Came Up With My Title

NaiNonTheN00b1, right?

This title was introduced at the time when I played <abbr title="Counter-Strike: Global Offensive">CS:GO</abbr> with my online friends. It was added to my previous title: NaiNonTH, since I wanted to get rid of the Thai branding on my name. All I did was change the TH at the end into **TheN00b1** because I sucked at the game (to this day).

### What about NaiNonTH?

NaiNonTH can be split into these three parts with their own meaning:

1. Nai - a romanized Thai word of นาย that means "Mr."
2. Non - my Thai nickname: นนท์
3. TH - A country code of Thailand.

Hence, this is why I prefer you to call me Non or NaiNon, and *not* Nai.

### Other Titles

Here are some of my other pennames:

* **NaiNonTH** - still being used today.
* **NotNaiNonTXD** - used for my roblox display name
* **NoncanbeZaza** - *deprecated*, but can still be found.
* **Minekoonnon** - too old.
* **Koonnon** - ancient.

## Minecraft

### How It Started

I started playing Minecraft in 2013, but I first learned it from my neighbor previously. However, though, it's not a legit one; it is like a custom Minecraft launcher—*similar* to TLauncher—sold in a department store as a disk to install, and it wasn't the latest version;

In 2019, I got my first personal computer, and it's the one I'm currently using. And that was the time I got my first Minecraft account. **But...** I didn't buy it from the official Minecraft website.

I actually bought it from a "second-hand" third-party Minecraft account store for a dirt-cheap 100 Thai Baht. It was an account that contained the other information that I could change into mine. You won't be able to find this kind of store now because of the new policy about owning a Minecraft account. It was later then migrated to my Microsoft account because... well, Microsoft.

<aside>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> I quoted-unquoted second-hand because I don't know if those accounts are actually what the store claimed to be second-hand</p>
</aside>

### Resource Packs, Data Packs, Websites, Whatever...

Since I love playing Minecraft with mods and resource packs, I felt like making one my own. [Foliage+](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/foliage+) was the first resource packs I've ever created, made with [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net).

You can read more about this on my [old Devsite's source code](https://github.com/NaiNonTH/dev-site/blob/main/markdown/about.md).

## osu!

### How It Started

I started playing osu! on May, 2020 from the invitation of my (not)weeb discord friend. I played it for not so long before I uninstalled the game. However, I reinstalled it after a week and has been playing it to this day.

### Small Facts

* **Hidden is my main mod** for my every play. After playing with it, I'm just stuck with it and can't go back playing No Mod. It's clean and not so hard to play with, while giving me some free PP.
* **I use osu!default plus skin.** It's the skin that stays true to the osu! default skin with additions that make the play easier, like transparent hitcircle, no sliderend circle, and a cursor that blurs nicely with my 75hz monitor.
* **I don't like [osu!lazer](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Help_centre/Upgrading_to_lazer)**, the "new generation" of osu!, and there are many reason for me to dislike it: its mouse input that is way worse than the original one due to its delay, the scroll animation on the song selection page that feels stiff, and its messy UI. Also, it has no significant gameplay improvement from the original.

## My PC

Copied from my [osu! profile page](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/17144141), here is the specification of my PC. Although it's pretty old, but it's still pretty good for my daily usage and games:

* **CPU:** Intel Core i5-8400
* **Motherboard:** ASUS PRIME B360-PLUS
* **RAM:** Kingston HyperX FURY 16GB/2666 DDR4 Dual-channel
* **GPU:** ASUS ROG STRIX GeForce GTX 1060 (6GB) GAMING
* **HDD:** WD Black 1TB
* **SSD:**
  * Lexar SSD 240GB
  * WD Blue 3D NAND SATA SSD 500GB
* **PSU:** Thermaltake 650W TR2 S

## My Accessories

* **Mouse:** [Saru MXB1 HAM White Wireless Gaming Mouse](https://www.itcity.in.th/en/product/SARU-GAMING-MOUSE-WIRELESS-MXB1-HAM-WHITE_PRD202408008080)
* **Keyboard:** [Loga Base 104 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard](https://logaworld.com/products/loga-base-104-barebone-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=46457526845578) ([ChaThai Tactile switch](https://logaworld.com/products/loga-mechanical-keyboard-switches-nomyen-chathai-35-pcs-box?_pos=1&_psq=Cha+thai&_ss=e&_v=1.0&variant=46069987180682))
  * A little note that I bought this as a "DIY" set with switches and keycaps. Despite having a "DIY" in the name, the staff built it for me.
* **Headset:** Nubwo X98
* **Unbranded Mouse Mat**. It has a World Map Pattern, with the size of <span style="display:inline-block;">80 cm x 30 cm x 3 mm.</span>

* **Keyboard:** Neolution E-Sport Hera (2019-2025)
