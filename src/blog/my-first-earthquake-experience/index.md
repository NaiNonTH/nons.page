The day when the Earthquake happened in <time datetime="2025-03-28">28th March, 2025</time> around 1:30 P.M., I just shut down my computer and was about to take a nap. Suddenly, I felt like my bed was shaking, and I felt a little bit dizzy. I thought it was my brother, but he said that the floor was shaking too. After I heard that from my brother, my thought was like: "...really? Is it really an Earthquake? In Thailand?"

However, the floor vibrated for only a while until it felt like it was gone (unnoticeable). It didn't shake that hard either, according to where I lived. So, I didn't think much about it and went back to the nap.

I then woke up at around 3-4 P.M. and scrolled through social media. And yes, there was an Earthquake... in Bangkok, Thailand. Buildings were cracked, everyone who lived in the buildings, like condo ran for their life, seemingly really terrified, and everything shook like it was the end of the world. Hell, there's even one that collapsed, and there were a lot of construction workers stuck in that pile of building debris, but I'll talk about that soon in this blog post.

## The Source

I heard that the center of the Earthquake is in Myanmar occurred due to the Sagaing Fault, and its impact also covered some part of Thailand.

## That Collapsed Building

The building that collapsed during the Earthquake was supposed to be an office for the State Audit Office of the Kingdom of Thailand. With the funding of over two billion Thai Baht, it was 30% done.

The thing is, though, it was the only building that collapsed in here, and not to mention that there were a lot of buildings that are still under construction or abandoned in Bangkok, yet they didn't collapse.

There were a lot of design flaws in that building, from missing pillars to missing beams. Overall, it was a building that was not well-constructed in the first place. And that has a lot of things to do with the corruption that is going on in here.

The Sathorn Unique Tower, an infamous building in Bangkok abandoned in 1997, is still standing firm to this day; even the Earthquake can't take it down (except for the financial crisis).

## After That

There were aftershocks happened in here a lot that night. My professor messaged to their students (including me) about what happened in the university and asked if we were okay.

Day by day, things are getting even more tough, man.
