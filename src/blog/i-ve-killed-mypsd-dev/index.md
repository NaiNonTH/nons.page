From [the last post](/blog/a-fresh-start-with-11ty), I've stated that I wanted a website that is in-between the Devsite — which is what **mypsd.dev** is — and my Neocities website. The time when this current website went live, those website are still active. But I, later then, killed them.

## Deleting My Old Sites

While also adding new features to my current website, I started off by deleting Neocities website first, because there was not much stuff in it but some projects that didn't really matter to me.

Right now, that website only contains the terminal that I still want to keep, the old button, and the message box at the landing page, saying that I've moved to Nekoweb. On that page, also, I wrote a little JavaScript code that redirects visitors that have visited that page before.

The **mypsd.dev**, on the other hand, had two pages that affiliate with many off-site things like my Minecraft Resource Packs Projects, and those are the [Terms of Use](/archive/terms-of-use) page and the [How To Download](/archive/how-to-download-minecraft-mod-packs-from-modrinth-and-github/) page.

Porting both two pages into my website didn't really take much time, since they both were written in markdown files. I could simply copy them from my old Devsite's source code into the new one. Once done, I did some polishing like removing things that is not supported by my website, beautifying some content, and adding some styling for something like Tables.

## Decision

Even though I had done importing all important pages from that website into this one, I decided to keep the Devsite active until the domain name expires because I still didn't know what to do with that website.

But then, I changed my mind.

I reverted the Domain Nameservers back into [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com)'s ones — the place where I bought the domain from — and completely removed the Devsite from my [Netlify](https://netlify.com) control panel. And yes, I was using Netlify. As the time of writing, the **mypsd.dev** redirects you to this Nekoweb website, and it will be like this until that domain name expires.

## But Why?

At this point, you might be thinking that I can simply continue using the **mypsd.dev** domain name with my current website — and you're right.

But there's a problem; the domain name that I registered was meant to be used for a website that *only* contains development and coding, but the current website doesn't only have those; since it is meant to be my personal space on the internet, it also contains things about me too, like the details about me, software that I use as a daily driver, etc.

Hence, the **mypsd.dev** domain name is kind of too limited for the scope of this website.

## Now What?

I'm not sure about this. Maybe I'll just let my future self tell me if I'm going to buy myself a new domain...

...and maybe moving out of Nekoweb... or not? Although it's not the fastest hosting service out there, it's very comfy here.
